# Week-2
Attached are the files of my Week 2 task. The web page I have made is a page which shows us a survey form related to shopping and also has a responsive buttons which help us submit and share our form and also go to instagram. I have attached pdf's of : 1. Codes 2. Output 3. UI Design 4. User Stories. This task helped me get more creative considering we had to make our own UI design. It helped me in imagining what I want my webpage to exactly look like and also make it true. The user stories task helped me explain to firstly myself what i would want if i would use such a webpage and thus make such thing.
